# Automated-Teller-Machine-Application---Java-

ATM (Automated Teller Machine) comes under the concept of self banking in today's digital
world.Going to a bank and making transaction through the staff can be an inefficient process due to
several reasons. As a solution for this, ATM became popular among people who live a busy life.

In this project I have implemented an ATM application using Java concepts.It includes the
following features;

• User registration
• User login
• Money Deposit
• Money withdrawal
• Checking balance
• Checking transaction history
• Inter bank Fund Transaction
